# Foodhub Data Analysis

## Overview
This project is an in-depth analysis of data from a food delivery platform, **Foodhub**, aimed at identifying key trends and insights that can drive the platform's growth. By analyzing customer behaviors, order patterns, and delivery performance, this analysis provides actionable recommendations to improve operations and user engagement.

## Motivation
Food delivery platforms operate in a highly competitive market where understanding user behavior and operational efficiency can make a significant difference. This project was created to:
- Explore key metrics and trends within the Foodhub dataset.
- Identify growth opportunities for the platform.
- Gain hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization with Python.

## Tools and Technologies
This project uses the following tools and libraries:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, Numpy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Processed raw Foodhub data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formatting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Examined order volumes over time to identify seasonal trends.
  - Analyzed popular food categories and customer preferences.
  - Evaluated delivery performance, including time efficiency and delays.
- **Visualizations**: Created detailed charts and graphs to illustrate key insights, including:
  - Trends in daily and monthly orders.
  - Heatmaps showing peak order times.
  - Bar charts for top-performing food categories.

> *Note*: The dataset used in this project is either fictional or publicly available. Sensitive information was not used in this analysis.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
Key findings from the analysis include:
1. **Delivery Times**: Delivery times are important to the health of the platform and correlate with a number of other variables. Currently the delivery times are somewhat left skewed, making them more evenly distributed and lowering average delivery times will be key to driving growth moving forward. This could be done with better traffic analytics, better distribution of delivery drivers, or a number of other factors.
2. **Order Costs**: Restaurants with higher order costs generate more revenue for the business so it might be worth trying to onboard some nicer restaurants that will typically have more expensive items on the menu. There is a trend for even fine dining establishments to be on delivery platforms so that might be something worth investigating for FoodHub as that would generate more revenue by percentage than others.
3. **Cuisine Type**: American, Japanese, Italian, and Chinese cuisine makes up about 80% of all business on the platform so onboarding more restaurants that serve that type of cuisine could be helpful in driving growth.
